# Potential Names of Project

# UPDATE 2021: 
This project will be renamed and will have a focus on producing bulk visualizations only. It will not at all serve as a place to write actual statistics. Revamping of the project will focus heavity on making a working and easy-to-use day-of-game API. Ideally a dashboard where input credentials are entered and output files are made. There will also need to be a form of plot structure used to generate different plots. This project is now officially under complete renovation of structure. 

Test team will be Rangers are I am a huge fan =)
